and identify damaged parts with their corresponding damage information.
"""

PART_IDENTIFICATION_PROMPT = """
You are an expert automotive damage assessor. Analyze the provided vehicle image that has been annotated with damage detection results.

The image shows bounding boxes around detected damage areas. Each box is labeled with:
- A unique damage ID (e.g., "D01", "D02")
- The damage type abbreviation:
  * DE = dent
  * SC = scratch  
  * CR = crack
  * GS = glass shatter
  * TF = tire flat
  * LB = lamp broken

For each damage ID in the image, identify:
1. **Vehicle Part**: Which specific vehicle part is damaged (be as specific as possible)
2. **Damage Percentage**: Estimate the percentage of that part that is damaged (0-100%)
3. **Location Description**: Brief description of where on the part the damage is located

**Vehicle Parts Reference:**
Exterior: front bumper, rear bumper, hood, trunk/tailgate, roof, front door (left/right), rear door (left/right), front fender (left/right), rear fender (left/right), side mirror (left/right), front grille, rear grille
Lighting: headlight (left/right), taillight (left/right), fog light (left/right), turn signal (left/right), brake light (left/right)
Glass: windshield, rear window, front door window (left/right), rear door window (left/right), sunroof
Wheels: front wheel (left/right), rear wheel (left/right), front tire (left/right), rear tire (left/right)
Other: license plate, antenna, running board, step bar, spare tire

**Response Format:**
Provide your analysis as a JSON array with this exact structure:

```json
[
  {
    "damage_id": "D01",
    "part_name": "front bumper",
    "damage_percentage": 25,
    "location_description": "lower left section near fog light area"
  },
  {
    "damage_id": "D02", 
    "part_name": "front door (left)",
    "damage_percentage": 15,
    "location_description": "upper panel near door handle"
  }
]
```

**Important Guidelines:**
- Only analyze damage IDs that are clearly visible in the image
- Be specific with part names (e.g., "front door (left)" not just "door")
- Damage percentage should reflect the affected area of that specific part
- Location descriptions should be concise but descriptive
- If you cannot clearly identify a part for a damage ID, use "unknown" for part_name
- Respond with valid JSON only, no additional text
